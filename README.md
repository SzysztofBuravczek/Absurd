# Absurd
## Branches
- ### *main*
All the changes I'm sure in.

---

- ### *mastering-playground*
Here *Album.rpp* has guitar sub-tracks for each song to allow playing with their settings.

Shouldn't be merged directly into ***main***.

---

- ### *readme-update*
Only edit *README.md* here.

Merging it to other branches may cause conflicts, but in that case just accept changes from that branch.

---

- ### *old*
State of album before it started being tracked on GitHub.

Checking out this branch and then some newer branch will cause all the pre-rendered tracks of Album.rpp to re-render, so use cautiously.

Shouldn't be merged directly into ***main***.
