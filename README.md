# Absurd
## Branches
- ### *main*
All the changes I'm sure in.

---

- ### *mastering-playground*
Here Album.rpp has guitar sub-tracks for each song to allow playing with their settings.

Shouldn't be merged directly with ***main***.

---

- ### *old*
State of album before it started being tracked on GitHub.

Checking out this branch and then some newer branch will cause all the pre-rendered tracks of Album.rpp to re-render, so use cautiously.

Shouldn't be merged directly with ***main***.
